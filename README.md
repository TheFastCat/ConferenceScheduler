# ConferenceScheduler
A Simple C# Conference Scheduler

1. Right-click the .sln and select "Build Solution"
2. Press the F5 button to launch the defaulted startup console project, RoundRobinSchedule1.csproj
   This console app outputs a processed conference schedule of the example data in the problem statement, using a "round robin" event scheduling strategy.
   Other console applications are presented to demonstrate outputs across data sets and scheduling strategies (ie "deep track")
3. The automated tests should be useful as documentation. 
   After building the .sln open Visual Studio's Test Explorer to execute the tests.
   The higher-level tests (DeepTrackTrackSchedulerTests & RoundRobinTrackSchedulerTests) may be most useful for stepping through with a debugger.
   
   Additionally, breakpoints can be set in the provided console applications for simplicity.
   
note: the requirements for this application are included in the .docx "Conference Scheduler Requirements"
